# Outbox Pattern Implementation 

C# .NET & PostgreSQL for Azure VM Creation Simulation

This solution employs the Outbox Pattern to reliably manage transactions and message publishing in a distributed system, specifically designed for simulating VM creation events on Azure Clouds. Leveraging C# .NET for its implementation and PostgreSQL as the underlying database, it addresses the common challenge of ensuring atomicity when both updating a database and sending messages to a message broker.

In the context of simulating Azure VM creation, when a request to "create a VM" is processed, the Outbox Pattern ensures that the internal state of your application (e.g., marking a VM as "pending creation") and the message indicating this event are committed within the same PostgreSQL database transaction. This is achieved through a robust C# .NET implementation that integrates seamlessly with your data access layer.

Instead of directly publishing messages to an external message bus, a record of the message (the "outbox message") is saved within this same PostgreSQL transaction as the VM creation request's data. Once the transaction is successfully committed, a separate C# .NET process (often a background service or a dedicated relay) then reliably reads these outbox messages from PostgreSQL and publishes them to the message broker. This guarantees that either both the internal data update and the VM creation event message are persisted, or neither are, thus preventing data inconsistencies or lost messages due to failures at any point in the process.

This approach ensures at-least-once message delivery and provides a robust mechanism for maintaining data integrity and and consistency across your services, crucial for accurate simulation and reliable event handling in an Azure cloud environment, all built on the C# .NET and PostgreSQL ecosystem.
