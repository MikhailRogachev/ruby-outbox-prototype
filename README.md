# Outbox Pattern Implementation 

C# .NET & PostgreSQL for Azure VM Creation Simulation

This solution employs the Outbox Pattern to reliably manage transactions and message publishing in a distributed system, specifically designed for simulating VM creation events on Azure Clouds. Leveraging C# .NET for its implementation, it uses PostgreSQL exclusively for transaction tracking of the outbox messages, addressing the common challenge of ensuring atomicity when both updating business data and sending messages to a message broker.

In the context of simulating Azure VM creation, when a request to "create a VM" is processed, the Outbox Pattern ensures that the update to your application's internal state (e.g., marking a VM as "pending creation" within your main business logic/database) and the corresponding message indicating this event are handled atomically.

Instead of directly publishing messages to an external message bus, a record of the message (the "outbox message") is saved within a dedicated Outbox table in PostgreSQL. This crucial step occurs within the same distributed transaction that commits the business data change. This architecture ensures that either both the internal business data update and the outbox message are successfully persisted, or neither are.

Once this transaction is successfully committed, a separate C# .NET process (often a background service or a dedicated relay) then reliably reads these outbox messages from PostgreSQL and publishes them to the message broker. This guarantees that messages representing VM creation events are not lost due to failures and provides at-least-once message delivery. This robust mechanism maintains data integrity and consistency across your services, crucial for accurate simulation and reliable event handling in an Azure cloud environment, all built on the C# .NET ecosystem with PostgreSQL providing the transactional backbone for the Outbox.
