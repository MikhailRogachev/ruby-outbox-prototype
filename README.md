# Outbox Pattern Implementation 

C# .NET & PostgreSQL for Azure VM Creation Simulation

This solution employs the Outbox Pattern to reliably manage transactions and message publishing in a distributed system, specifically designed for simulating VM creation events on Azure Clouds. Leveraging C# .NET for its implementation, it uses PostgreSQL exclusively for transaction tracking of the outbox messages, addressing the common challenge of ensuring atomicity when both updating business data and sending messages to a message broker.
